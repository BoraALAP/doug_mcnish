          <p>
            Doug McNish knew that he was destined for a career in the kitchen
            when he began honing his skills at the age of 15, quickly learning
            all the intricacies of the food service industry. Although adept in
            his field, by the age of 20, Doug knew that he needed to make a
            change after watching footage of a slaughterhouse.
          </p>
          <p>
            He went vegetarian, and months later adopted a fully vegan
            lifestyle. It wasnâ€™t long before he positioned himself as a pioneer
            in the vegan food movement, courageously aligning his career path
            with his morals in a time when veganism was relatively unknown.
